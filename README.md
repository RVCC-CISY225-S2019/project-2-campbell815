## Project 2 The Creations 

### Instructions:
Download the clone of your completed Project 1 repo.
Copy your P1 folders and files into this repo.
Commit your repo and push it to GitHub.
You are going to add a footer that looks like the header. Add a semantic HTML footer (with class footer) element to your HTML code. See the header element that is already there for an example. The footer has to go in the correct spot in the index.html file. It goes in right after the main close tag and before the body close tag.
   </main>
   <footer class="footer"> footer stuff goes here </footer>
</body>
Note: You should regularly commit and push to your master branch.

Add a copyright statement inside your footer using your name. See your textbook to get the code for a copyright symbol.

Look at the picture in this repo's design folder. You are going to make changes to the CSS to copy how the footer looks in the picture.

One of the first things to change is the background color of the header and footer.

Go to Coolors and keep hitting space bar until you see a color you like.

Select ONE fairly dark color (your choice) and take note of its hex code.

Change your CSS so that the "hero", "iama" and the "footer" classes are your chosen color theme.

You are going to replace the current font with a different one. Notice the line in the head tag that says:

<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:300,400,600,700' 
      rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
and in styles.css

body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  margin: 0;

}
Search for "Google Fonts" on the Internet. Once in that page, use the top-left search for Fira Sans. Select Fira Sans and, to the selection, add font weights 400 and 600 (in the Customize tab). See the Google Fonts Cheat Sheet Images below.
Copy and paste the 2 pieces of code Google gives you (in the Embed tab).
Replace the link that goes into the head element of index.html.
Replace the font-family rule in the styles.css file.
From the design picture, note the look of the text in the footer matches the text of the person's name in the header. You should add css that does the same for your footer that is done in the hero class.
